# BankAccount

This is a working Bank Account app written in Python. 

Users have the ability to create a new account, deposit, withdraw, print the balance, and add interest
to the bank account balance. You can also print a receipt with the sensitive information blocked out. 

To run the app, type "python3 BankAccount.py" and you'll see the sample code working.
